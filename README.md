## User Story
AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## Acceptance Criteria

* GIVEN a single-page application portfolio for a web developer
* WHEN I load the portfolio
* THEN I am presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer
* WHEN I view the header
* THEN I am presented with the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio
* WHEN I view the navigation titles
* THEN I am presented with the titles About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted
* WHEN I click on a navigation title
* THEN I am presented with the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading and that title is highlighted
* WHEN I load the portfolio the first time
* THEN the About Me title and section are selected by default
* WHEN I am presented with the About Me section
* THEN I see a recent photo or avatar of the developer and a short bio about them
* WHEN I am presented with the Portfolio section
* THEN I see titled images of six of the developer’s applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repository
* WHEN I am presented with the Contact section
* THEN I see a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message
* WHEN I move my cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text
* THEN I receive a notification that this field is required
* WHEN I enter text into the email address field
* THEN I receive a notification if I have entered an invalid email address
* WHEN I am presented with the Resume section
* THEN I see a link to a downloadable resume and a list of the developer’s proficiencies
* WHEN I view the footer
* THEN I am presented with text or icon links to the developer’s GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, and their profile on a third platform (Stack Overflow, Twitter)

## What I Learned

Throughout the development of this project, I gained a deeper understanding of several key concepts and technologies related to React:

React Component Lifecycle: I learned about the different lifecycle methods in a React component, such as componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount. Understanding these methods allowed me to control what happens at different stages of a component's life.

State Management: I learned how to use React's useState and useEffect hooks for managing component state and side effects. This was crucial in making the components dynamic and responsive to user interactions.

Asynchronous Operations: I learned how to handle asynchronous operations in React, such as fetching data from an API. I used the async/await syntax along with useEffect to handle this.

Error Handling: I learned how to handle and debug errors more effectively in a React application. This included handling errors in promises, managing loading and error states, and displaying error messages in the UI.

Testing: I used testing libraries like Jest and React Testing Library to write unit and integration tests for the components. This helped me ensure that the components were working as expected and made the development process more reliable.

This project was a valuable opportunity to apply and expand my React development skills. I faced several challenges along the way, but overcoming them helped me become a better developer. I look forward to applying these learnings to future projects.
